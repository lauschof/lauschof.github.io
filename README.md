## Project Requirements

### Content
 I added a little introduction to the project and gave it a little name (haha). On the main page I also added my profile with my picture and a contact form. "Projects" website is just empty atm and I'll work on it on my own. "Contact" links straight to the contact form on the main page. I also added my personal links to the footer. 
- [ ] At least one profile picture
- [ ] Biography (at least 100 words)
- [ ] Functional Contact Form
- [ ] "Projects" section
- [ ] Links to external sites, e.g. GitHub and LinkedIn.
​
### Technical
 I think I have managed to include every techinal aspect.. Struggled with my @media queries, for some reason I didnt get them to work (mainly because I was unsure what I wanted them to do..)
- [ ] At least 2 web pages.
- [ ] Version controlled with Git
- [ ] Deployed on GitHub pages.
- [ ] Implements responsive design principles.
- [ ] Uses semantic HTML.

### Bonus (optional)
When hovering on header's nav bar, the links show "bold". On desktop the header's logo switches position.

- [ ] Different styles for active, hover and focus states.
- [ ] Include JavaScript to add some dynamic elements to your site. (Extra tricky!)
​
### Screenshots
> Please include the following:
> - The different pages and features of your website on mobile, tablet and desktop screen sizes (multiple screenshots per page and screen size).
> - The different features of your site, e.g. if you have hover states, take a screenshot that shows that.  

> You can do this by saving the images in a folder in your repo, and including them in your readme document with the following Markdown code:
